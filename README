An HTML 5 based consultant toolkit, targeting mobile devices such as iPhone and iPad. 

You are a ThoughtWorks tech lead and you are doing inception at client site for an upcoming project. You have lot of stuff to be done in a week and you don't want to miss any of them. Beyond that, you want to know how other ThoughtWorkers do such stuff. 

Jungling provides you an existing checklist about "How To Do An Inception". You open it when you can access internet (say, when you are in hotel), keep it on your iPad. And when you work with the client, you check items and add your comments. After the whole checklist becomes green, you can say "I have done my job within an inception".
